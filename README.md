How to use this function:

Preparation:
Set browser size to 1260x1024 using the chrome extension "windows resizer"
Look at the website in question and make a screenshot, for example using extension "Screen Capture"

Animation:
Most front pages these days have some kind of rotation going on. If you want to, you can capture a number of screenshots and
name additional screenshots with the same name as prefix followed by a sequence number.
For example "mainsite.png", "mainsite2.png", "mainsite3.png" etc.

Create a blank slide in powerpoint in the appropriate industry section and run this macro
You will be asked for the name of the file(s) and how many there are.

When that is done the macro will insert these screenshots, size them appropriately and add 2 second automatic fade animation
between each of them.

Test it by pressing "Shift-F5" in powerpoint.
